This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.

Flavio remarks:

* Using Ubuntu 18.08 LTS to build
  - GCC-9 installed for this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1140183/install-gcc-9-on-ubuntu-18-04

* Coova-chili version 1.4 doesn't build:
  - Error reported in: https://github.com/coova/coova-chilli/issues/200
  - Solution merged: https://github.com/coova/coova-chilli/pull/453/files
  - I updated manually the code to continue building
    Maybe replacing the version to 1.5 or 1.6 might solve this building issue directly
